# Homelab Blueprint: An Outline to Help You Build a Successful Homelab

Here's a high-level roadmap and a more detailed outline to help fellow enthusiasts dive into the world of homelabs, while incorporating enterprise best practices in a relatable and enjoyable manner. As someone who's been in tech for quite some time, many of the concepts weren't new, but I had never been responsible for the entire ecosystem. I've spent the last six months actively building my homelab, learning from this fantastic community, amazing YouTubers, and engaging in various homelab Discord servers. One challenge I faced was understanding the bigger picture and knowing where to start. For me, having a solid outline and plan was a game-changer. So, here's my current plan, which I'm considering expanding into a full-fledged guide. I hope this helps others kickstart their homelab journey more efficiently. I'm open to any feedback or suggestions you might have. Happy homelabbing, folks!

## High-Level Roadmap
