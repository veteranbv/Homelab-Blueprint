# Homelab Blueprint: An Outline to Help You Build a Successful Homelab

Here's a high-level roadmap and a more detailed outline to help fellow enthusiasts dive into the world of homelabs while incorporating enterprise best practices in a relatable and enjoyable manner. As someone who's been in tech for quite some time, many of the concepts were familiar, but I had never been responsible for the entire ecosystem. I've spent the last six months actively building my homelab, learning from this fantastic community, amazing YouTubers, and engaging in various homelab Discord servers. One challenge I faced was understanding the bigger picture and knowing where to start. For me, having a solid outline and plan was a game-changer. So, here's my current plan, which I'm considering expanding into a full-fledged guide. I hope this helps others kickstart their homelab journey more efficiently.

Also, I received some great feedback on this guide. First and foremost, it's your journey, so pay special attention to your goals and desires with your homelab. Have fun, and make it yours. It doesn't have to be perfect or enterprise class. The below is less a prescriptive guide on what you must do and more of a choose-your-own-adventure guide.

I'm open to any feedback or suggestions you might have.

Happy homelabbing, folks!
